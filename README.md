# Lambda - A Scheme Implementation

This is my toy interpreter. Do not expect a complete implementation at this time.

# Installation

	git clone https://github.com/macoun/lambda.git
	cd src
	make

The executable `lambda` will be created in the _src_ directory.

# Run

To interpret a source file

	./lambda ../examples/sandbox.scm

To land in the REPL console. Yes, you guessed it.

	./lambda

# License

It will probably be MIT licensed. At this level feel free to do what you want with the code unless you recently killed a kitten.
